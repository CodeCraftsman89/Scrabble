Scrabble (English Scrabble â€” "rummage in search of something") is a board game in which two to four players compete in the formation of words using letter wooden tiles on a board divided into 225 squares. In the Russian-speaking environment, it is also known by the names "Scrabble" or "Wordmaker". 1

The rules of the game:
At the beginning of the game, each player receives 7 random letters. 1
You can compose several words in one move. Each new word must touch or have a common letter (or letters) with previously composed words. 1
The words should be read from left to right (horizontally) and from top to bottom (vertically). 1
The first composed word must pass through the central cell. 1
If a player does not want or cannot compose a single word, he has the right to change any number of his letters, while skipping a turn. 1
After each turn, it is necessary to get up to seven new letters. 1
If a player has used all seven dice during a turn, then he is awarded an additional 50 points. 1

The game ends in the following cases:
when one of the players runs out of chips in his hands, and there are no more chips to finish (they are all in his hands or on the field); 1
when all players consistently missed a turn two rounds in a row. 1
